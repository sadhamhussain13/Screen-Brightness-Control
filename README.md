# Screen-Brightness-Control
Screen Brightness Control with Hand Detection by using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
## OpenCV and Mediapipe use in Python
- OpenCV is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. OpenCV supports a wide variety of programming languages like Python, C++, Java, etc. It can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human. 
* The MediaPipe Hand Landmarker task lets you detect the landmarks of the hands in an image. You can use this Task to localize key points of the hands and render visual effects over the hands. This task operates on image data with a machine learning (ML) model as static data or a continuous stream and outputs hand landmarks in image coordinates, hand landmarks in world coordinates and handedness(left/right hand) of multiple detected hands.
## Libraries Required
* Mediapipe - `pip install mediapipe`
* OpenCV - `pip install opencv-python`
* Numpy - `pip install numpy`
* Screen Brightness Control - `pip install screen-brightness-control`
